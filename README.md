# Instalytics

Instalytics is a vanilla python script to crawl through the open pages and hashtags on instagram.

Analyse the posts based on posting frequency on monthly and weekly basis, likes per post, comments per post.

Additionally, visualize the trends of likes,comments and users with maximum comments for posts.

Visualized the results using plotly libraries.

For interactive visualization, run the instalytics.ipynb file on google colab and key in the handle or hashtag.

Future work: Sentiment analysis on post comments.
